In your code, add the method to handle that action. For instance,

.h file

- (IBAction)buttonTapped:(UIButton *)sender;
.m file

- (IBAction)buttonTapped:(UIButton *)sender
{
  NSLog(@"Button Tapped!");
}
Now, open you xib file, right click to File's Owner, there you should see your method, drag the plus circle onto your button. You should see a bunch of different actions, most of the time touchUpInside is what you are looking for.
